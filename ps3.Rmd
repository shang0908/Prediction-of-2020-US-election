# Model

# Creating the Model
model_logit_1 <- glmer(vote_trump ~ (1 + education|state) + race + age + labforce + sex,
                       data = reduced_survey, 
                       family = binomial)
model_logit_2 <- glmer(vote_biden ~ (1 + education|state) + race + age + labforce + sex,
                       data = reduced_survey,
                       family = binomial)
```
Here, we decide to build random coefficient logistic regression models in R about Trump and Biden's vote count by frequentest approach. By looking at the past presidential elections, we noticed that there are some states that voted for neither of the two most popular candidates. Thus the prediction on vote count will be more precise with two separate model on Biden and Trump than with one. Also, we choose to change the numeric variable age into age group because we want to know the preference of the young, mid-aged and elderly. The two models for Trump and Biden's vote count are shown below.
$$P(Y_{i}={Trump}) =logit^{-1}(\beta_{0} + X^{edu}_{state[ij]} +\beta^{race}_{ij}+\beta^{age}_{ij}+\beta^{labforce}_{ij} + \beta^{sex}_{ij} )$$
$$P(Y_{i}={Biden}) =logit^{-1}(\beta_{0} + X^{edu}_{state[ij]} +\beta^{race}_{ij}+\beta^{age}_{ij}+\beta^{labforce}_{ij} + \beta^{sex}_{ij})$$
where $\beta_{0}$ is the fixed base intercept and $\beta^{race}_{ij}$, $\beta^{agr}_{ij}$, $\beta^{labforce}_{ij}$, $\beta^{sex}_{ij}$ represent coefficients associated with each categorical variable. The $X^{edu}_{state[ij]}$ shows the random effect education with condition on state. The subscript $_{ij}$ indicates the $j$ state to which the education$i$ respondent belongs. Except for the variable race, p-values of all of the other predictors are significant that are less than 0.05, indicating we could reject the null hypothesis.

```{r,echo=F,message=F}
#check the model
prob1 <- predict(model_logit_1, type=c('response')) #trump predict
prob2 <- predict(model_logit_2, type=c('response')) #biden predict

roc1 <- roc(reduced_survey$vote_2020, prob1)
auc(roc1)
plot(roc1, auc.polygon=TRUE, print.auc = TRUE, asp = NA) #draw the roc for Trump

roc2 <- roc(reduced_survey$vote_2020, prob2)
auc(roc2)
plot(roc2, auc.polygon=TRUE, print.auc = TRUE, asp = NA) #draw the roc for Biden

```

The receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve will be use to check the diagnostic ability of our models. We will obtain the ROC curve by plotting the sensitivity (true positive rage) against 1-specificity (true negative rate). The AUC (area under ROC curve) values is respectively 0.6865 for "Trump model" and 0.6065 for "Biden model" which means that there is 68.65%/60.65% chance to discriminate between Trump/Biden gets the vote or not. Then, we use the binned plot to check the residuals. Since the gray lines represent ±2SE bands, which we would expect to contain about 85% of survey data about vote for Trump. Since the majority of the fitted values fall within the SE bands for both models, this model is reasonable.

```{r,echo=F,message=F}

binnedplot(fitted(model_logit_1), residuals(model_logit_1, type = "response"),
           nclass = NULL, xlab = "Expected Values", ylab = "Average residual", 
           main = "Binned residual plot for Trump", 
           cex.pts = 0.8, 
           col.pts = 1, 
           col.int = "gray") #draw the binnedplot for Trump model
binnedplot(fitted(model_logit_2), residuals(model_logit_2, type = "response"),
           nclass = NULL, xlab = "Expected Values", ylab = "Average residual", 
           main = "Binned residual plot for Biden", 
           cex.pts = 0.8, 
           col.pts = 1, 
           col.int = "gray") #draw the binnedplot for Biden model
```

## Post-Stratification 
Post-stratification is a method used to adjust the sampling weights. It could increase the representativeness of the sample, so we have greater confidence of our result. In order to correct for sampling bias, we need to perform a post-stratification analysis. Since "Winner take all" and each state is represented different number of electors, we create cells based off different states. Using the model described in the previous sub-section, we estimate the proportion of voters in each state. Then we weight each proportion estimate in each state by the population size of that bin respectively. Finally, we compare the proportion of voting for Biden and Trump in each state. Due to "winner-take-all", the winner is the one with higher proportion and he will take all electoral votes of that states. By summing them up for each person, we get the result.

```{r,echo=F, message=F}
reduced_census$trumpestimate <-
  model_logit_1 %>%
  predict(newdata = reduced_census, type = "response") #estimate chance of voting for trump

reduced_census$bidenestimate <-
  model_logit_2 %>%
  predict(newdata = reduced_census, type = "response") #estimate chance of voting for biden

vote_2020_pred <- ifelse(reduced_census$bidenestimate > reduced_census$trumpestimate, "Joe Biden", "Donald Trump") #the final vote

predictresult <- cbind(reduced_census, vote_2020_pred) #combine the result 


predictresult$trump_votes <- ifelse(predictresult$vote_2020_pred == "Donald Trump", predictresult$perwt, 0) #add the perwt to get number of people that the respondents represent

predictresult$biden_votes <- ifelse(predictresult$vote_2020_pred == "Joe Biden", predictresult$perwt, 0) #add the perwt to get number of people that the respondents represent 
 
predictresult %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(Trump = sum(trump_votes), Biden = sum(biden_votes)) -> predicted_states #group by state and find the votes they get

```

# Results
In the 538 polls of electoral colleges, Trump will win 339 votes. As a result, our estimate of the proportion of voters for Donald Trump is 0.63, based off our post-stratification analysis on the random coefficient logistic regression model above. （（In particular, Democrats states include Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan and Oregon. On the contrary, Alabama, Mississippi, Kansas and Idaho are loyal to the Republican party. Our predicted results tell us all others except for Oregon vote for their original party they support with a enormous gap. But the voting is not too dramatic in Oregon, Republicans win with just 7% of the vote.））

# Discussion
The survey data and the census data are collected from the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape ‘Full Data Set’ and IPUMS USA website respectively. In order to predict 2020 US election and to observe which variables obtain significant relation with the response variable(vote_2020), we construct the intention variable and perform a clean process for changing in demographic variables. However, the survey data could not represent the whole population(as shown in the weakness). Therefore, we use the MRPs to correct the bias. We build the Multilevel logistic regression model with random effect on the individual level survey data. Then, we divide the poll into 51 cells by states. In the post-stratification process, we count the actual effective votes by electoral college in each state. The candidate who gets the most votes gets the votes of all the state's electors.
The result shows Trump will win 2020 US general election, the Democrats party being 0.63 among 538 polls of electoral colleges. Some politicians think he focuses on four states, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Those four are traditionally Democratic states, but each of them have selected a Republican governor since 2010. Investors think the election outcome may influence the stock market.It will lead to portfolio winners and losers for that election uncertainty.
## Weaknesses & next step
Firstly, despite the large sample size, the pool of survey respondents is far from being representative of the voting population. we compares the demographic composition of survey to that of the census. We plot the two most striking differences variables: labforce and education below.

```{r, echo=F,message=F}

totalsurvey = nrow(reduced_survey)
totalcensus = nrow(reduced_census)  #calculate the total of census and survey
reduced_survey %>%
  group_by(labforce) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), surveyratio = n()/totalsurvey) -> labforce #count the labforce of survey
reduced_census %>%
  group_by(labforce) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), ratiolabforce = n()/totalcensus) -> censuslabforce #count the labforce of census
cbind(labforce, censusratio = censuslabforce$ratiolabforce) -> labforce
labforce = as.matrix(labforce[, 3:4])
rownames(labforce) = c("no, not in the labor force", "yes, in the labor force")
colnames(labforce) = c("survey", "census") #create the matrix
labforceplot <-ggplot(melt(labforce), aes(x = Var1, y = value, col = Var2), ylab = "ratio") +
  ggtitle("the comparison of labor force ratio in survey and census") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = Var2), size = 1) +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 0.8) #draw the plot
```
We could observe that people who have taken college and above account for the largest proportion of about 40% in the survey, compared to only 30% college and above graduate in the census. High school graduate make up 28% of the survey but only 18% of the census. 

```{r, echo=F,message=F}
reduced_survey %>%
  group_by(education) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), surveyratio = n()/totalsurvey) -> education
reduced_census %>%
  group_by(education) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), ratioeducation = n()/totalcensus) -> censuseducation
cbind(education, censusratio = censuseducation$ratioeducation) -> education
education = as.matrix(education[, 3:4])
rownames(education) = c("college graduation and above", "Don't graduate from HS", 
                "High school graduate", "some college")
colnames(education) = c("survey", "census")
educationplot <- ggplot(melt(education), aes(x = Var1, y = value, col = Var2), ylab = "ratio") +
  ggtitle("the comparison of education ratio in survey and census") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = Var2), size = 1) +
  ylim(0, 0.5) +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 3) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(vjust = 1,
                                   hjust = 1,
                                   size = 7))
ggarrange(educationplot, labforceplot,
          ncol = 1, nrow = 2)
```

Moreover, people in the labor force dominated the survey population: they comprises about 75% of the survey dataset. By contrast, the proportion of "in the labor force" and "not in the labor force" is much more close to each other. We would like to make our survey data more representative since it is the base of forecasting.
Secondly, we just partition our data into 51 cells to simplify and reduce the running time at the cost of accuracy. It does not correct the model perfectly. We could partition our data and involve more cells in the future stage.
What's more, according to Zalesny(1985), economic factors are very important in vote preference. However, our dataset does not include any variable related to economic factors since the census dataset just has personal income while survey has household income. We will include it in the next stage.
Lastly, we will compare our estimation with the actual election results and do a post-hoc analysis of how to better improve estimation in future elections.
